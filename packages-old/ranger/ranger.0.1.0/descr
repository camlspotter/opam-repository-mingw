A consecutive range slice library for strings, arrays, etc.

The main type provided by ranger generalizes substrings to arbitrary data
structures that are "indexed" by an integer. The biggest difference between
ranger and other libraries like it (e.g. various Substring functors) is that
ranger doesn't use functors and is polymorphic over the base type (e.g. char in
the case of substrings).
