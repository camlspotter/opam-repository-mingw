ppx_monadic: ppx extension for monadic do notation.
ppx_monadic
=================================

ppx_monadic is a PPX syntax extension for monadic 'do' notation.

ppx_monadic follows the tradition of pa_monad, a CamlP4 syntax extension
for `do` notation. Basically code with pa_monad should work with ppx_monadic
only by replacing `perform` by `do_;`. (I find `perform` is bit too long to type.)
