Xentropyd: provide entropy to Xen VMs

It is difficult to find good entropy sources in a virtualised environment,
since VMs do not have direct access to real hardware devices. Xentropyd
is a stand-alone service which runs in domain 0 (like xenconsoled), connecting
to domains and offering them entropy from the host, subject to a rate-limit.

This is similar to virtio-rng.
