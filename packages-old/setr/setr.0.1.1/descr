Abstract domain library for sets

SETr is an interface for set abstractions. It defines common infrastructure for
abstracting set constraints for use in an abstract interpreter. Built upon this
interface, it provides a number of included abstractions usable as libraries.
These included abstractions are tuned for high-performance, symbolic (no known
constants), relational (constraints over multiple variables) constraints.
