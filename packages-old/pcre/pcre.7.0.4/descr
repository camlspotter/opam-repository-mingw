Interface to the PCRE (Perl-compatibility regular expressions) library
This OCaml-library interfaces the C-library PCRE (Perl-compatibility
Regular Expressions). It can be used for matching regular expressions
which are written in "PERL"-style.

PCRE-OCaml offers the following functionality for operating on strings:
* Searching for patterns
* Extracting subpatterns
* Splitting strings according to patterns
* Pattern substitution
