Persistent data structure library from OCaml Summer Project 2007 sponsored by Jane St. Capital.
It provides: single linked lists, O(1) catenable lists, acyclic double linked lists, random access lists, double ended queues,
binomial and skew binomial heap, AVL, red/black, splay and Patricia Maps and Sets with
zipper style (persistent and bi-directional) cursor interfaces, along with functor combinators
to minimize boilerplate.
