Modelica abstract syntax and parser
Modelica_ml is a Modelica frontend implemented in OCaml. It is written
with compilation in mind, but should also be useful for other
applications. Modelica_ml currently supports abstract syntax, parsing,
pretty printing and a form of lookup analysis (class normalization).
Patches welcome!
