Virtual network interface and software switch for Mirage.

Provides the module Vnetif which can be used as a replacement for the
regular Netif implementation in Xen and Unix. Stacks built using
Vnetif are connected to a software switch that allows the stacks to
communicate as if they were connected to the same LAN.
