Unicode text normalization for OCaml

Uunf is an OCaml library for normalizing Unicode text. It supports all
Unicode [normalization forms][1]. The library is independent from any
IO mechanism or Unicode text data structure and it can process text
without a complete in-memory representation.

Uunf has no dependency. It may optionally depend on [Uutf][2] for
support on OCaml UTF-X encoded strings. It is distributed under the
BSD3 license.
