GEDCOM parsing.

First release parses a GEDCOM file easily, and creates the tree
representation of the file.
There is no real record type such as FAMI or INDI, just a generic
line representation.
No check is perform on file or parsed lines, so GEDCOM not
respecting official structures will be parsed without complaining.
