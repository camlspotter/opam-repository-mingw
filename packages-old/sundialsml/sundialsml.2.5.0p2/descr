Sundials/ML is an interface to the Sundials suite of numerical solvers.

Sundials is a collection of five numerical solvers: CVODE, CVODES, IDA,
IDAS, and KINSOL. This interface provides access to all features of the
underlying library.

The structure of the OCaml interface mostly follows that of the original
library, both for ease of reading the existing documentation and for
converting existing source code, but several changes have been made for
programming convenience and to increase safety, namely:

- solver sessions are mostly configured via algebraic data types rather than
  multiple function calls;

- error conditions are signalled by exceptions not return codes (including
  in user-supplied callback routines);

- closures (partial applications of functions) are used to share user data
  between callback routines;

- vectors are checked for compatibility with a session (using a combination
  of static and dynamic checks), and;

- explicit free commands are not necessary since OCaml is a
  garbage-collected language.

The OCaml documentation contains extensive cross-links to the original
documentation. OCaml versions of the standard examples usually have an
overhead of about 50% compared to the original C versions, and almost never
more than 100%.
