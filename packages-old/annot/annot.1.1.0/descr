annotation parser for external editors and IDEs

This tool uses the `.annot` files generated by OCaml to lookup annotations from
OCaml source code, and hence show inferred type declarations in an IDE.

Since OCaml 4.01, there is a more efficient `.cmt` file that is not supported
by this tool. If you are using a recent version of OCaml, you should use the
Merlin (`opam info merlin`) suite instead. This `annot` tool is only supported
for legacy compatibility with the older plaintext `.annot` files.
