This collection of BSD Make directives aims at providing a highly
portable build system targetting modern UNIX systems and supporting
common or less command languages.  This is a build system, which means
that it can be used to organise fairly complex projects.

distribution of projects comprising the following types of products:

 - C programs, compiled for several targets
 - C libraries, static and shared, compiled for several targets
 - Shell scripts
 - Python scripts
 - OCaml programs
 - OCaml libraries, with ocamldoc documentation
 - OCaml plugins
 - TeX documents, prepared for several printing devices

   either as part of a TeX document or as standalone documents
