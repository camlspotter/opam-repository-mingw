quest - generates C code for testing a C compiler's calling convention

Quest generates C code for testing C compilers. A test is run by compiling
the generated code it with the compiler under test and subsequently
executing the binary that the compiler produced. A compiler bug manifests
itself by an assertion failure during the execution of the binary. This
leads to automatic testing: generate and execute tests until an assertion
failure is found.

The code generated by Quest tests one specific part of a C compiler: how it
implements passing values to a function by function call and returning a
value from it using the return statement. Stated simpler, the generated
code by Quests checks that a value passed to a function is indeed received
unaltered from the caller and likewise when a valuereturned to the caller.
